Analysis files:
1) 1_clustering.R does hierarchical clustering hybrid tree cut on the syllable data to generate syllable types
2) 2_analysis.R generates the observed summary statistics and runs the Bayesian logistic regression
3) 3_simulation_abc.R runs both the simulations and approximate Bayesian computation

Data files:
- data.RData the analyzed syllable data from Luscinia
- cbc_trends.RData contains population trends according to the Christmas Bird Count
- clustering.RData the results of syllable clustering (from 1_clustering.R)
- hybrid_tree_cut.RData the results of hybrid tree cut (from 1_clustering.R)
- obs_sum_stats.RData the observed summary statistics for the three analysis years (from 2_analysis.R)
- predictions.RData the results of approximate Bayesian computation (from 3_simulation_abc.R)
